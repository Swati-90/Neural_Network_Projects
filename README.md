# Neural_Network_Projects
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

<b>1. Mnist Number Dataset:</b> MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
<p> <b> Data Source:</b> The dataset has been loaded through the inbuilt function of keras dataset however this dataset can be downloaded from <a href=https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/ target="_blank"> here. </a> </p>
<p> <b>My Code:</b> I have used the Convolutional Neural Network to built the project which can be access here. </p>
<p> <b>GUI App:</b> Along with performing the neural network opearion to solve the dataset I have built an GUI canvas app using Tkinter which you can also use to predict the numbers in real time. and the code for the gui app can be access here</p>
